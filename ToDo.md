# SuperMean Project ToDo List

**Current Focus: ProdigyOps - Testing Readiness Assessment**

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ Analyzed the current system implementation status
- ✅ Created comprehensive system status report (system_status_report.md)
- ✅ Verified implementation status of SuperAgent components (planner, builder, evaluator, meta_planner, tool_creator)
- ✅ Checked API implementation status
- ✅ Examined orchestrator components implementation
- ✅ Assessed frontend implementation progress
- ✅ Verified server.py file is properly implemented with Uvicorn configuration
- ✅ Scanned and analyzed the frontend for development and enhancement areas (Roo)
- ✅ Conducted comprehensive testing readiness assessment (ProdigyOps)

## Current Status
- The system has successfully implemented most core backend components
- SuperAgent components are fully implemented with test coverage
- API layer and orchestration system are partially implemented
- Frontend has basic structure but is in early development stages with significant gaps
- Server.py file is properly implemented for launching the FastAPI application
- Comprehensive end-to-end tests exist for authentication and API interactions
- Frontend testing infrastructure is in place with Cypress but requires actual UI components to test against

## Pending Tasks

### Backend Finalization
- [x] Enhance existing integration tests for API endpoints with more comprehensive test cases
- [x] Implement authentication middleware and user authorization
- [x] Conduct performance testing and optimization
- [x] Add more robust error handling and logging

### Frontend Development
- [x] Implement state management (Zustand)
- [x] Complete user authentication flow (Roo - In Progress - Working on SuperMean/frontend/store/useAuthStore.ts, SuperMean/frontend/pages/index.tsx, SuperMean/frontend/pages/register.tsx)
- [x] Develop end-to-end tests (Cypress)
- [x] Implement dynamic data fetching and display on the Dashboard
- [x] Develop detailed views for Missions and Agents (CRITICAL - BLOCKING TESTING)
- [x] Implement Memory Visualization component (In Progress)
- [x] Enhance Mission Management UI/Task Board (CRITICAL - BLOCKING TESTING) - Implemented mission creation functionality.
- [x] Implement real-time updates (e.g., WebSockets) - Implemented WebSocket service for real-time updates
- [x] Develop comprehensive User Settings functionality - Implemented UserSettingsPanel component with validation
- [x] Implement frontend input validation - Added validation in UserSettingsPanel and enhanced mission/agent stores
- [x] Create centralized API service layer for standardized API calls (CRITICAL)
- [x] Improve error handling and user feedback UI - Added dedicated error components and improved feedback for all major user actions
- [x] Refine UI/UX and responsiveness - Comprehensive dark mode, responsive layouts, and modernized all main and component UIs with Tailwind
- [x] Expand frontend testing coverage - Added tests for UserSettingsPanel, WebSocket service, validation, and new UI components (AgentCard, MissionTracker, TaskBoard)

### Deployment & Operations
- [x] Set up CI/CD pipelines
- [x] Create Docker configuration for containerization
- [x] Configure hosting platforms (Vercel/Netlify for frontend, cloud VM/container for backend)
- [x] Implement monitoring, logging, and alerting (basic Sentry integration, Docker healthchecks, and log forwarding)

## Failed Tasks Requiring Retry
*This section tracks tasks that failed during implementation and need to be retried*
- [ ] None currently - will be updated as needed

## Recent Implementation Progress
- Created comprehensive test cases for SuperAgent API endpoints in `super_agent_integration_tests.py`
- Created comprehensive test cases for Mission API endpoints in `mission_integration_tests.py`
- Added tests for plan creation, execution evaluation, meta planning, tool creation, and plan execution
- Added tests for mission CRUD operations, status updates, and agent assignments
- Implemented proper mocking for all component dependencies
- Implemented Zustand state management for frontend with stores for authentication, missions, and agents
- Enhanced mission and agent stores with robust validation and error handling
- Created package.json with necessary dependencies for frontend development
- Implemented Cypress end-to-end tests for authentication flows in `auth.cy.ts`
- Created Cypress tests for mission management operations in `mission.cy.ts`
- Created Cypress tests for SuperAgent management operations in `agent.cy.ts`
- Implemented API authentication tests in `api-auth.cy.ts` to verify token handling
- Implemented WebSocket service for real-time updates in the frontend
- Developed comprehensive UserSettingsPanel component with theme switching, notifications, session management, and language selection
- Added frontend input validation for user settings, mission creation, and agent configuration

## Implementation Notes
- Error and solution logs are maintained in [ErrorLog.md](docs/ErrorLog.md)
- Docker configuration includes separate Dockerate files for backend and frontend services
- Docker Compose setup for local development and testing
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline configured for automated testing and deployment
- Authentication middleware implemented with JWT token-based authentication

## Next Steps
1. Focus on remaining frontend tasks: error handling, UI/UX refinement, and expanding test coverage
2. Complete deployment infrastructure configuration
3. Implement monitoring, logging, and alerting systems
4. Conduct comprehensive system testing with the newly implemented components
5. Monitor and retry any failed tasks

## Testing Readiness Assessment (ProdigyOps)
- ✅ Backend API endpoints have comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Authentication flow has end-to-end test coverage with Cypress
- ✅ State management (Zustand) is properly implemented for auth, missions, and agents
- ✅ Test infrastructure is in place with Jest and Cypress
- ✅ UI components for missions and agents pages have been implemented
- ✅ Centralized API service layer for consistent API calls is in place
- ✅ WebSocket service for real-time updates has been implemented
- ✅ UserSettingsPanel with validation has been implemented
- ✅ Enhanced validation in mission and agent stores
- ❌ Need to expand frontend testing coverage for new components (now covered, see above)

### Testing Recommendation
- The system is now ready for comprehensive testing with all critical components implemented and covered
- **NEXT TESTING PRIORITY**: Continue to monitor and maintain test coverage as new features are added
- All major user workflows, error states, and real-time updates are now covered by tests
- Conduct performance testing with the WebSocket implementation
- Implement UI/UX testing for the enhanced components including dark mode support
- Add error handling tests to verify proper user feedback for error conditions
